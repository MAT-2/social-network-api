## Summary

I had a lot of ups and downs with this fun project. This is a project creating a social network API using MongoDB. Being able to connect between API routes and controllers to create a basic database is exciting to see. However, I had to deal with a lot of debugging that involved reviewing from correct naming conventions, to type errors that I had to deal with. Of course, that was part of the fun understanding both the interesting as well as the frustrating parts when a developer is first developing an application designed as a social network. This projects gives me a lot of exposure as the correct way of organizing code infrastructure, as well as learning how to debug errors that have occured.
